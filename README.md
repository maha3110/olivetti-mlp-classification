# Olivetti Faces MLP Classifier

## Overview

The Olivetti Faces MLP Classifier is a machine learning project that uses a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network to classify facial expressions in the Olivetti Faces dataset. This project demonstrates image classification and neural network techniques applied to facial recognition.

## Dataset

The Olivetti Faces dataset contains 400 grayscale images of 40 individuals, each with ten different facial expressions, captured under various lighting conditions. This dataset is commonly used for tasks such as face recognition and emotion classification.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

Before running the classifier, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- Keras
- TensorFlow (or other compatible backend)

### Running the Classifier

1. Clone this repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/maha3110/olivetti-mlp-classification.git
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd olivetti-mlp-classifification

3. Run the classifier

## Customization
You have the flexibility to customize the behavior of the classifier to experiment with different configurations. To do so, open the mlp_classifier.py script and modify hyperparameters, model architecture, or dataset preprocessing according to your preferences.

## Results
After running the classifier, you can assess its performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results of the classifier will be displayed in the terminal, providing insights into its performance on facial expression classification.
